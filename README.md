# KYOEVO

This repository contains the code I wrote together with Prof. Chris Vincenot during my visit as PhD student to the biosphere lab of the Dept. of Social Informatics within the Kyoto University.  The code is working, but inalpha stage: at the moment it correctly initialize an environment, and populate it with artificial programs able to execute simple operations. A fitness function evaluates the operation outputs, and selects the organisms with the best one.
